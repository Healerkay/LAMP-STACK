# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Introduction

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software products. It encompasses a series of phases that guide the project from its inception to its completion.

## Phases of SDLC

### 1. **Planning**
   - Define project scope, goals, and objectives.
   - Conduct feasibility studies and assess risks.
   - Create project timelines and allocate resources.

### 2. **Analysis**
   - Gather and analyze requirements from stakeholders.
   - Create detailed functional and technical specifications.
   - Identify constraints and dependencies.

### 3. **Design**
   - Develop system architecture and design.
   - Create wireframes, prototypes, and mockups.
   - Define database schema and data models.

### 4. **Development**
   - Write code according to design specifications.
   - Implement features and functionalities.
   - Conduct code reviews and ensure coding standards.

### 5. **Testing**
   - Develop test plans and test cases.
   - Execute various types of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance).
   - Identify and report bugs for resolution.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - Prepare for deployment by configuring servers and environments.
   - Conduct deployment in stages or all at once, depending on the project.
   - Monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

### 7. **Maintenance**
   - Provide ongoing support and maintenance.
   - Address bug fixes and implement updates.
   - Enhance features based on user feedback.

## SDLC Models

Various SDLC models exist, including:

- Waterfall Model
- Agile Model
- Iterative Model
- Spiral Model
- V-Model

Each model has its own advantages and is suitable for different types of projects.

## Conclusion

The Software Development Life Cycle provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently, on time, and within budget. By following a well-defined SDLC, development teams can deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of stakeholders.
